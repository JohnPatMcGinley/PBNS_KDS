# PBNS_KDS

Up-to-date PBNS record implementation. Use the llc_fnl file that I emailed as the data is much more cleaned up. Current issue is that it breaks on line 2556 because one of the fields is "EAGLE HOME MORT" which is currently being read as 3 different inputs.

Have just been running it in eclipse
